# RestaurantHub
Restaurant Hub is a tip calculator app made for iOS. The simple app allows users to calculate the tip based on a percent. If the user is part of a group, the app makes it easy to determine how much each person should pay including tip. One of the main functionalities that differentiates this app from others is that it allows for users to save how much they paid at certain restaurants for future reference.

# Future Goals
As of right now, the app allows users to save restaurants and how much they paid at that restaurant on the given day. The hope is that future implementations of the app will learn the eating habits of the user (based on type of restaurant, amount of money paid, etc.) and start to suggest new restaurants in the area that serve the same type of food, price point, location, and time of day. The idea is that Restaurant Hub leverages food rating apps such as Yelp in order to become your personal food connoisseur. Who wouldn't want that? :P
